This project communicates between 2 Clients and 1 Server. First, the server listens to 2 different ports. When client 1 runs, packages start to be sent from the client to the server from the txt file in the specified location on the server. However, the capacity of the buffer on the server can hold a maximum of 12 packets. As soon as client2 starts running, packet transmission begins. and txt file is successfully transferred to client2.
